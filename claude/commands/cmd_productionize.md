# Productionize App Agent Rules

When asked to productionize an application for deployment:

## Overview

Transform development code into production-ready applications through systematic, methodical analysis, improvement, and deployment preparation. Supports multiple frameworks and deployment targets.

**Quality Over Speed Mandate**: Take time to be thorough and comprehensive. Focus on quality implementation over rapid completion. This is production-critical work that requires careful attention to detail.

## Usage Patterns

```bash
/productionize                          # Auto-detect framework, general production prep
/productionize flutter testflight       # Flutter app for TestFlight
/productionize react vercel            # React app for Vercel deployment
/productionize nodejs docker           # Node.js app for Docker deployment
/productionize python heroku           # Python app for Heroku
/productionize vue netlify             # Vue app for Netlify
```

## Workflow

### 1. **Initial Analysis & Planning**

- **Always start with TodoWrite tool** to create a comprehensive task list
- **Breadth AND Depth Navigation**: Look beyond immediate scope to understand:
  - Related systems that might be affected
  - Broader architectural implications
  - Integration points and dependencies
  - Edge cases and potential failure modes
  - Long-term maintenance considerations
- Analyze codebase structure and identify the framework/stack
- Read existing documentation (README, package.json, pubspec.yaml, etc.)
- Identify deployment target and requirements
- Create systematic task breakdown covering all productionization phases
- **Proactive Question Analysis**: Identify critical production questions the user hasn't asked yet

### 2. **Codebase Analysis Phase**

- **Architecture review**: Analyze project structure, dependencies, and patterns with methodical thoroughness
- **Comprehensive Production Readiness Audit**: Systematically identify potential issues:
  - Hardcoded values and missing environment configurations
  - Missing error handling and edge case coverage
  - Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
  - Security vulnerabilities and data exposure risks
  - Missing caching and state management
  - API pagination and data fetching issues
  - UI/UX polish and accessibility concerns
  - Rate limiting and abuse protection
  - Offline support and network failure handling
  - Data validation and sanitization
  - Memory leaks and resource cleanup
  - Cross-platform compatibility issues
  - Third-party service dependencies and fallbacks
- **Framework-specific checks**: Apply framework-appropriate best practices with deep domain knowledge
- **Critical Questions Analysis**: Document what production concerns the user should consider but hasn't addressed

### 3. **Implementation Phase**

Execute improvements systematically with methodical attention to detail, updating TodoWrite progress frequently:

**Quality Focus**: Each implementation step should be thorough and well-tested. Don't rush through tasks - take time to implement robust, production-grade solutions.

### 7. **Quality Assurance Checklist**

Before marking productionization complete:

- [ ] All configurations are environment-aware
- [ ] Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] Caching is implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance is optimized for target platforms
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Deployment process is tested and reliable
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are configured
- [ ] User experience is polished and accessible
- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks are completed

### 8. **Proactive Question Analysis & Next Steps**

After completing productionization, **ALWAYS** provide:

#### **Critical Questions the User Should Have Asked**
Systematically identify and present production concerns the user hasn't considered:

**Example Framework-Specific Questions:**
- **Flutter**: "Have you considered rate limiting for API calls? What happens when the device goes offline? How will you handle app store review rejections?"
- **React/Web**: "What's your strategy for SEO and social media previews? How will you handle bot traffic? What about GDPR compliance for user data?"
- **Node.js**: "How will you monitor server health in production? What's your database backup strategy? How will you handle traffic spikes?"
- **Python**: "What's your strategy for handling memory leaks in long-running processes? How will you manage database migrations in production?"

#### **Actionable Next Steps Checklist**
Provide a prioritized, concrete list of post-productionization actions:

```markdown
## Immediate Next Steps (Complete within 48 hours)
1. [ ] Test deployment pipeline end-to-end in staging environment
2. [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for critical metrics
3. [ ] Create rollback procedures and test them
4. [ ] Validate all environment variables are properly configured

## Short-term (Complete within 1 week)
1. [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for production debugging
2. [ ] Set up automated backup procedures
3. [ ] Create incident response playbook
4. [ ] Conduct load testing with realistic traffic patterns

## Medium-term (Complete within 1 month)
1. [ ] Establish performance benchmarking and alerting
2. [ ] Implement A/B testing framework if applicable
3. [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation
4. [ ] Plan for scaling based on usage growth projections
```

### 9. **Framework Detection Logic**

Auto-detect framework based on:
- **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml`, `.dart` files
- **React**: `package.json` with React dependencies
- **Vue**: `package.json` with Vue dependencies
- **Node.js**: `package.json` with server dependencies
- **Python**: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `.py` files
- **Go**: `go.mod`, `.go` files

### 10. **Best Practices**

- **Use TodoWrite religiously** - Track every phase and task with granular detail
- **Quality over speed mentality** - Take time to implement robust solutions rather than rushing through tasks
- **Be methodically systematic** - Don't skip phases even if they seem obvious; thoroughness is critical
- **Breadth AND depth analysis** - Always consider broader architectural implications beyond immediate scope
- **Document decisions comprehensively** - Explain why certain production choices were made with context for future maintainers
- **Proactive questioning** - Always identify what the user should have asked but didn't
- **Test deployment rigorously** - Verify the deployment process works before completion
- **Focus on real-world user experience** - Production means real users with real problems will interact with this
- **Plan for scale and failure** - Consider what happens when usage grows AND when things break
- **Security first mindset** - Never compromise on security for convenience
- **Measure twice, deploy once** - Thorough testing and validation prevents production issues
- **Always provide actionable next steps** - Give users concrete, prioritized actions to take post-productionization

### 11. **Success Criteria**

The application is production-ready when:
- It handles real-world usage patterns gracefully
- Error scenarios are covered with appropriate user feedback
- Performance is optimized for the target deployment platform
- Configuration can be managed without code changes
- Documentation enables others to deploy and maintain the application
- The deployment process is reliable and repeatable
- Monitoring and observability are in place for production operations

## Notes

- **Methodical thoroughness is paramount** - Take time to be comprehensive rather than rushing through tasks
- Always adapt to the specific framework and deployment target with deep domain expertise
- Prioritize based on the application's critical user flows and real-world usage patterns
- Focus on production concerns, not development convenience
