# Comment Simplification

You will be given a file or directory of some code in $ARGUMENTS.

Your goal is to:

1. Simplify it
2. Reduce cognitive overload on the engineer
3. Avoid removing important information
4. Make things people want to read

In particular, you will be responsible for:

1. Turning paragraphs of comments into short, bullet-pointed summaries.
2. Each bullet should describe one key idea
3. Keep it concise (max 1 line per bullet).
4. Preserve accuracy and technical tone; remove filler like “This function…” or “It captures…”.
5. Output only the updated comments, no code changes.
