# Write or Edit Idiot Proof Documentation

This rule relates to updating or writing documentation.

## Things to do

- **Favor brevity:** default to bullet points and concise sentences.
- **Show the layout:** add a “Code Structure” section when it clarifies the project’s file/folder organization.
- **Map the terrain:** use clear headings & sub-headings so readers can scan quickly.
- **Teach by example:** include a “Getting Started” code snippet that demonstrates basic usage.
- **Expose configuration:** if the project relies on environment variables, list them in a table with name, purpose, and default.
- **Pick tables when clearer:** choose a table over prose whenever it improves readability.
- **Ship the result:** provide the finished document as a Markdown (`.md`) file.
- **Think copy-paste:** write snippets that work verbatim so readers can drop them into a terminal or editor.
- **Assume short attention spans:** surface the most important info early and avoid fluff.
- **Preserve substance:** keep every piece of original content—only re-phrase or re-order for clarity.

## Things not to do

- Add a code structure section for documentation where it's not relevant
- Changing a sentence to a bullet point when there's only one point.
- Adding newlines when its unnecessary
